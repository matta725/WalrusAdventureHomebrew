Caves with volcanic or geothermal activity are the most highly prized teostra's lair, creating hazards that hinder intruders and letting searing heat and volcanic gases wash over a teostra as it sleeps. On rare occasions they can be seen living in more temperate areas such as a swamp or ancient forest, changing the area around it to suit its needs.",
								"A teostra's lair is sometimes confused with a red dragon's lair due to both of them mainly preferring areas with intense heat. On many occasions a teostra will attempt to take a red dragon's lair for its own, either by killing the red dragon or causing it to flee while gravely injured, leaving its horde of treasure behind. The teostra will guard this horde, mainly because it now belongs to him, but will typically not add to its treasure, being more concerned with intruders than riches.",
								"A teostra encountered in its lair has a challenge rating of 14 (11,500 XP). A tempered teostra's challenge rating remains the same."
